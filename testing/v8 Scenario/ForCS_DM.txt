DisturbFireTransferDOM    
>> This table determines the fire impacts on the DOM and soil pools. Zero and the default is no transfers.
>> We allow only certain transfers at this point.
>> From any pool to Gas, from aboveground pools and snags to FPS (Forest Products Sector), and from snags to the ground 
>> (stem to medium or other to fast above)
>> No other transfers are allowed.

DisturbFireTransferBiomass
>> This transfers material from the biomass pools to the DOM, FPS, or air when it's killed by the fire extension. 
>> If there is mortality from a fire,as determined by the fire extension, but nothing in this table

>> You can't force the combustion of any biomass pools (e.g. foliage) with this table.
